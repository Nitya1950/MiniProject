<h1>Maternal  and Pediatric Care</h1>
<hr/>
<h2>Maternal Nursing Care</h2>
<p>Maternity nursing care begins in the prenatal period. Although some women may seek care earlier, an expectant mother is most likely 
to enter the healthcare system somewhere between the fourth and twelfth week of pregnancy. Should that entry be delayed until the second or 
even third trimester, the risk of complications rises. The nurse may provide maternal care at any point during the prenatal period,
 during labor and delivery or in the post-partum period. Few nurses, however, are present during each stage of a pregnancy for an individual 
woman, so the nurse’s ability to communicate with other members of the health care team is vitally important skill. 
An offshoot of maternal health nursing is the specialty practice of fertility promotion and preconception maternal health.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Pediatric Nursing Care</h2>
<p>Pediatric care begins in the immediate period after delivery and continues until the child is considered an adult, 
usually at the age of 18. It encompasses all phases of development. Although pediatric care includes nursing a child who is injured, 
ill or has a developmental disability, in many cases, the nurse working in pediatrics is focused on preventive care and the promotion of normal child development.</p>
<br/>
<h2>Nursing Tasks in Maternal Care</h2>
<p>Nursing tasks in maternal care include many basics, such as nursing documentation, hygiene, sterile technique and patient transfer techniques. 
Others that are specific to maternal nursing include:</p>
<br/>   
<ul>
<li>Obtaining a health history specifically related to this and previous pregnancies.</li>
<li>Performing pregnancy and other lab or diagnostic tests and interpreting them for the patient.</li>
<li>Patient education about the normal stages of pregnancy and child development.</li>
<li>Caring for women who have developed complications related to pregnancy, such as toxemia.</li>
<li>Assisting a woman through the stages of labor and delivery.</li>
</ul> 
<br/>
<h2>Nursing Care of the Newborn</h2>
<p>Pediatric nursing care begins in the immediate postpartum period. Once the child is safely delivered, the nurse must:</p>
<br/>
<ul>
<li>Provide immediate care such as suctioning mucous, keeping the infant warm, cleaning the baby and administering medications.</li>
<li>Assist the mother in breastfeeding or basic newborn care.</li>
<li>Assess for signs of problems such as respiratory distress.</li>
</ul>
